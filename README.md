# Polygon Graphics

Create polygon-style graphics using an existing graphics image.  The code uses a Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to create polygons that fit within points defined by the user.  Images can be colored with multiple color sampling options, and all images can be exported as PNG or SVGs.  Images be saved to the Amazon S3 cloud for future use, and multiple historical versions can also be saved.

### Things you can do:

  - Upload an image
  - Place vertices at will
  - Programmatically place vertices in a random or grid pattern
  - Select color and fill options
  - Draw points in geometric shapes
  - Export images as png or svg format
  - Save images for later use/editing
